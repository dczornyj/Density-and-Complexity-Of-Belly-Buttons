# Density-and-Complexity-Of-Belly-Buttons
In analyzing a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (found at http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), this project reflects the trends/differences in the types of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) found within the belly buttons of a sample set of individuals. 

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive dashboard in which the end user is able to select by individual, which would then display the selected individual's demographic information, a bar chart reflecting the top 10 OTUs found in that individual, as well as a bubble chart showing each sample that was found in the selected individual.

The resulting interactive dashboard is viewable on a live published Github-pages domain that can be found at:
